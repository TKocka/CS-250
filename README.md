## Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
### This course focused on Scrum-Agile methodology while exploring the stages of the SDLC for a hypothetical travel company site.

"How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?"
- User needs are determined through meeting with the client, conducting focus groups, and maintaining open and transparent communication throughout the process from planning to deployment of the final product. User stories help the team gain a clear picture of exactly what a user needs or wants to do with the product and how the product should function.

"How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?"
- I approach the development of programs with an open mind as to how each company or team operates, and a willingness to be flexible but responsible not just in my work but in my ethical considerations as well. While Agile is not the only methodology used in real world computer science-related settings, I found it to be one of the most preferred and praised methodologies used in a vastly growing field of technology. I am most impressed with the aspects of flexibility and the encouragement of team "ownership" in their meetings and processes, and I hope that I can incorporate these as well as the transparent, open communication processes into my future work.

"What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?"
- I think several characteristics make a good team member: respectful, professional, efficient and timely with communication, dependable, organized, attentive, and considerate among many others. A good team member trusts in their team and does their part without "taking over" nor neglecting their responsibilities to the team. Communication is a key characteristic for good team members to have, as well as a willingness to share ideas and be a lifelong learner.
